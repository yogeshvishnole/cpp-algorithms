<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Classes</h1>

<h2>History of C++</h2>
Bjarne Stroustrup of Bell Labs extended the C language to be capable
of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it became popular in the
1990's as C++.  There were several enhancements, but the central change was
extending <code>struct</code> to allow it to contain functions
and use inheritance.  These extended structs were later renamed <i>classes</i>.  
A C++ standard was established in 1999, so 
there are variations in the exact dialect that is accepted by pre-standard
compilers.


<h2>Public and Private parts</h2>
All member fields in a class are <i>private</i> by default 
(no code outside the class can reference them), whereas
fields of a struct are <i>public</i>, meaning that anyone
can use them. For example,

<pre class="example">
struct Product {
   char mfg_id[4];    // 4 char code for the manufacturer.
   char prod_id[8];   // 8-char code for the product
   int  price;        // price of the product in dollars.
   int  qty_on_hand;  // quantity on hand in inventory
};
</pre>
could be rewritten as a class like this
<pre class="example">
class Product {
<b>public:</b>
    char mfg_id[4];    // 4 char code for the manufacturer.
    char prod_id[8];   // 8-char code for the product
    int  price;        // price of the product in dollars.
    int  qty_on_hand;  // quantity on hand in inventory
};
</pre>
