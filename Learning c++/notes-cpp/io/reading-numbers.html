<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Reading numbers</h1>

<h2>Idiom: Read from <code>cin</code> in a <code>while</code> loop</h2>
   The standard C/C++ style for reading is to put the read operation
   in a while loop condition.  If the read proceeds correctly, then
   the value is true.  If there is an end-of-file (EOF) meaning that the
   end of the data has been reached, or if there is an error in reading,
   then the value returned is false and execution continues at the end 
   of the loop.
   
<h2>Example -- Adding numbers in the input</h2>
   <div class="fragment">
   <pre>
   int sum = 0;
   int x;
   
   while (cin &gt;&gt; x) {
       sum += x;
   }
   
   cout &lt;&lt; sum;</pre>
   </div>
   
<h2>Anti-idiom: Checking for EOF instead of reading</h2>
The following code does almost the same thing as the code above, but
it has disadvantages.
   <div class="fragment">
   <pre>
   int sum = 0;
   int x;
   
   cin &gt;&gt; x;       // BAD idiom for input.
   while (cin) {   // Required by inadequate Pascal I/O.
       sum += x;   // Should not be used in C++.
       cin &gt;&gt; x;
   }
   
   cout &lt;&lt; sum;</pre>
   </div>
<ul>
<li><b>Duplication</b>.  The input is read in <i>two</i> places, not one.
    Duplicate code creates an opportunity to update one and not the other
    when modifying the program.
    </li>
<li><b>More code</b>. The reading and testing is split between three lines instead of one.
    This makes it more difficult to read and maintain.
    </li>
<li><b>Possible failure</b>.  The GCC I/O library, which is used by DevC++, does
    a good job with this.  However, I've used systems that behaved differently 
    using the <code>while (cin)</code> test, depending
    on whether there is whitespace after the last value.  Think about it.  
    The issue is rather subtle - how does the I/O system know that you aren't going to
    read the blanks after the last value?  Well, it can't really know, so it makes 
    some assumptions.  Not all systems make the same assumptions about how to handle
    trailing whitespace after the last value.
    </li>
</ul>
