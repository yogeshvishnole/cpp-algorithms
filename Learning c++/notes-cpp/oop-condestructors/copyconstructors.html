<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: OOP: Copy Constructors</h1>

<h2>When copies of objects are made</h2>

<p>A <i>copy constructor</i> is called whenever a new variable is created from an object.  
This happens in the following cases (but not in assignment).
</p>

<ul>
<li>A variable is declared which is <i>initialized from another object</i>, eg,
<pre class="fragment">
Person q("Mickey"); // constructor is used to build q.
Person r(p);        // copy constructor is used to build r.
Person p = q;       // copy constructor is used to initialize in declaration.
p = q;              // Assignment operator, no constructor or copy constructor.</pre>
</li>

<li>A value parameter is initialized from its corresponding argument.
<pre class="fragment">f(p);               // copy constructor initializes formal value parameter.</pre></li>
<li>An object is returned by a function.</li>
</ul>

<p>C++ calls a <i>copy constructor</i> to make
a copy of an object in each of the above cases.  
If there is no copy constructor defined for the class, C++ uses the default
copy constructor which copies each field, ie, makes a <i>shallow copy</i>.
</p>


<h2>Don't write a copy constructor if shallow copies are ok</h2>

<p>If the object has no pointers to dynamically allocated memory,
a shallow copy is probably sufficient.  Therefore the default
copy constructor, default assignment operator, and default
destructor are ok and you don't need to write your own.
</p>


<h2>If you need a copy constructor, you also need a destructor and <code>operator=</code></h2>

<p>If you need a copy constructor, it's because you need something like a
deep copy, or some other management of resources.  Thus is is almost
certain that you will need a destructor and override the assignment operator.
</p>


<h2>Copy constructor syntax</h2>
<p>The copy constructor takes a reference to a <code>const</code> parameter.  
It is <code>const</code> to guarantee that the copy constructor
doesn't change it, and it is a reference because a value parameter
would require making a copy, which would invoke the copy constructor, 
which would make a copy of its parameter, which would invoke the copy constructor, which ...
</p>

<p>Here is an example of a copy constructor for the Point class,
which doesn't really need one because the default copy constructor's action
of copying fields would work fine, but it shows how it works.
</p>
<pre class="fragment">
//=== file Point.h =============================================
class Point {
    public:
        . . .
        Point(const Point&amp; p);   // copy constructor
        . . .
//=== file Point.cpp ==========================================
. . .
<span class="hilite">Point::Point(const Point&amp; p) {
    x = p.x;
    y = p.y;
}</span>
    . . .
//=== file my_program.cpp ====================================
. . .
Point p;            // calls default constructor
Point s = p;        // calls copy constructor.
p = s;              // assignment, not copy constructor.
</pre>


<h2>Difference between copy constructor and assignment</h2>

<p>A copy constructor is used to initialize a <i>newly declared</i> variable from
an existing variable.  This makes a deep copy like assignment, 
but it is somewhat simpler:
</p>

<ol>
<li class="compact">There is no need to test to see if it is being initialized from itself.</li>
<li class="compact">There is no need to clean up (eg, delete) an existing value (there is none).</li>
<li class="compact">A reference to itself is not returned.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Unaddressed issue</h2>

<p>[Question: When is the base (parent) class copy constructor called?
Is it like Java and the parent constructor is called at the
beginning of each constructor?  Does it have to be explicit?]
