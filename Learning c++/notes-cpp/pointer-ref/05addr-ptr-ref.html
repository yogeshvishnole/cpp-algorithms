<h1><a href="../index.html">C++</a>: Addresses, Pointers, References</h1>

<h2>Memory addresses</h2>
Every byte in memory has an integer memory <b><i>address</i></b>.  
Addresses start at zero and go to the maximum amount of memory that
the computer has.  For example, in a computer that has 256 MB of RAM
the bytes would be numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc (up to the power of 2 closest 
to 256,000,000).  Instructions and data are stored in RAM when a program is
running, so each instruction or data element is identified by its memory 
address, or the address of its first byte because many types are longer than one byte. 
The CPU uses these memory addresses for all operations.
One of the great advantages of higher-level language is that all these 
addressing details are taken care of automatically by the programming
language and the programmer doesn't have to worry about them.  
However, it can be very useful for the programmer to be able
to explicitly use memory addresses as data.  This data type is 
called a <b><i>pointer</i></b>.



<h2>Pointers</h2>
C and C++ have variables that 
hold memory <i>addresses</i>.  These are called <b><i>pointers</i></b>.  
Pointers are an extremely powerful
programming feature, long regarded as essential to any full-strength
programming language.  But the power of pointers also comes at a price, and  
safe use of pointers turns out to be rather difficult in large programs and
the source of many bugs.  The most common uses of pointers are:

<ul>
<li>Working with <i>arrays</i>, especially char arrays.</li>
<li>For <i>dynamic memory allocation</i> of data structures.</li>
<li>To <i>link</i> data structures together.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pointers are so powerful they are dangerous.
They are dangerous because they can access any memory location and a small 
error in their use can have mysteriously bizarre results, often showing up
only later in execution or when the program is run in a different environment.
It is estimated that about 50% of the bugs in production ("shrink-wrapped") software
are due to pointer misuse.  Consequently, some languages do not have pointers,
and only have a more restricted
use of memory addresses called <i>references</i>.
<p>

<p>See <a href="10pointers.html">Pointers</a></p>


<h2>References - Pointers with restrictions</h2>
A much safer and simpler use of memory addresses are <b><i>references</i></b>.  References
are pointers that can't be modified with addition and 
subtraction.  Removing this capability makes references
much safer to use than pointers.  In addition, they are automatically
dereferenced so the programming notation is simpler and less error prone.
Newer programming languages, such as Java, have completely eliminated pointers
and only use references for greater reliability and security.

<p>The most common use of references is in function parameters.  
   Passing a reference to a value has two advantages.</p>
   <ul>
   <li>It is more efficient than passing a large structure.  With OOP this
       is the main use of references.</li>
   <li>It allows the parameter to be changed.</li>
   </ul>
