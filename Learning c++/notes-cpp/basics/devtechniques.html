<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Development Techniques</h1>

<p>Here are some techniques to help develop your programs.
   </p>
<h2>Use Extreme Programming (XP) techniques</h2>
    <p>Some of the more useful XP techniques.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Start very small.  Get it running.</li>
    <li>On each iteration, add only a tiny bit of functionality.  Compile.  Test</li>
    <li>Tests should be written before the code!  In fact there is a popular movement
        called <i>Test-Driven Development</i> (TDD) based on this idea.</li>
    <li>Have two people work on all code.  Or at least review the code.</li>
    <li>Use Object-Oriented Programming (ie, classes) for all you code.</li>
    </ul>
    
<h2>Other useful techniques</h2>
   
<ul>
<li><b>Use <code>cerr</code></b> or <code>cout</code> to print intermediate results so that you can
    see what the program is doing.  So you can turn this on and off, create
    a debug switch so you don't have to remove the cerr's later.  Print a 
    prefix at the beginning of each message (eg, the function name) so that you know where it came from.
    For example,
    <pre class="example">
if (debug) cerr &lt;&lt; "setName: name='" &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "'" &lt;&lt; endl;</pre>
    </li>
    
<li><b>Use <code>at()</code></b> instead of subscription when accessing elements
    in a vector.  <code>at()</code> checks that the subscript
    is in a legal range.  For example
    <pre class="example">
sum = sum + weight.at(i);  // Checks subscript range.</pre>
Instead of
<pre class="example">
sum = sum + weight[i];     // No subscript range checking.</pre>
    </li>
    
<li><b>Use <code>assert</code></b> to verify that things are as you think they are.  
    This is very useful in functions that use pointers
    and expect a non-null pointer.  Include &lt;cassert&gt;.  For example,
    <pre class="example">
assert(mylist!=NULL);</pre>

    <p>There are approaches to development such as <i>Design by Contract</i>
       (also called <i>Contract-Driven Development</i>) which emphasize writing
       pre- and post-conditions.  Assert is one of the ways to implement this.
       </p>
    </li>
    
<li><b>Separate the user interface from the logic</b> as much as possible.
    Put the code in separate files.  The logic should have a header file
    that describes what it can do.
    </li>
    
<li><b>Think in terms of classes</b> -- grouping data and functions together
    that represent one element in your solution.  When defining the classes,
    write the header file description first as a nice summary of what has to
    be done.
    </li>
    
<li><b>Use standard library structures</b> (eg, the STL classes) in preference to writing your own.
    </li>
    
<li><b>Always write constructors</b> for your structs/classes so that there are no
    unititialized fields.
    </li>
</ul>
