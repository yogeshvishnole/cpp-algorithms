<h1><a href="../index.html">C++</a>: -&gt; Operator</h1>

The arrow operator, -&gt; (that's a minus sign followed immediately by a greater than), 
dereferences a pointer to select a field.
It is common to dynamically allocate structs, so this operator is
commonly used.
For example, 
<pre class="example">
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

Point* p;      // declare pointer to a Point struct

p = new Point; // dynamically allocate a Point
p-&gt;x = 12;  // set the field values.
p-&gt;y = 34;</pre>

<h2>The -&gt; operator is convenient, but not necessary</h2>
There usual pointer dereference operator (*) and field selection operator (.)
can be used to reference fields.  The last two lines of the above example
could be written as
<pre class="example">
(*p).x = 12;  // set the field values.
(*p).y = 34;</pre>
Note that the parentheses are needed to control the order of operator evaluation.
Arrow is more commonly used than the *. combination because it's more readable.
