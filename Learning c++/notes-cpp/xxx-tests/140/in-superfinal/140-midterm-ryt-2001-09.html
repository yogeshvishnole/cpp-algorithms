<li>(3 points) Translate this <b>for</b> loop into an equivalent <b>while</b> loop.
<pre>
   . . . 
   int sum = 0;
   for (int i=n; i&gt;0; i--) {
       sum += i;
   }
   cout &lt;&lt; sum;
   . . .
</pre>
</li>


<li>(5 points) Write a program that reads two floating point numbers from the 
    input and prints their <b>average</b>.  You don't need a loop for this.
    Assume there are always two numbers in the input stream.
</li>


<li>(10 points) Write a program which reads a sequence of integers
    and counts how many times the number 55 occurs.  Print the count.
    For example, with input 55 25 1004 4 -6 55 0 55, the output
    should be <b>3</b> because there were 3 55's in the input stream.
    Your program should work for any input, not just this example.
</li>

<li>(15 points) Write a program which reads numbers, then prints
a parallelogram with edges that are that size.  For example,
when it reads the number 5, the output would be
<pre>
  *****
   *****
     *****
      *****
       *****
</pre>
Hint: If n is the number that is read in, there will be n rows of 
n stars.  Each successive row will have one more blank 
at the beginning.
</li>
