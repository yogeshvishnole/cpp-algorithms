<h2>Part I.B - Writing Programs (36 points)</h2>
<ol><li>(15 points) Fill in the blanks in the following program.
    You may notice that the names aren't the same as those we
    used in the similar example in class, and there are some
    other small variations.  The comments explain what the program
    does.
<pre>

// Program that reads numbers greater than zero, sorts them
// from low to high, and prints them 10 per line.
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
   const int ASIZE = 10000;
   int __________[ASIZE];
   int size __________ 0;  // number of elements in array
   
   //--- read only numbers &gt; 0 into the array
   while ((size &lt; __________) &amp;&amp; (cin &gt;&gt; bb[size])) {
       if (bb[size] &gt; __________) {
           size++;
       }
   __________
   
   //--- sort the array from low (bb[0]) to high
   for (int f=0; f&lt;__________-1; f++) {
       for (int d=f+1; d&lt;size; d++) {
           if (bb[__________] __________ bb[f]) {
               int __________ = bb[d];
               bb[d] __________ bb[f];
               bb[__________] = n;
           }
       }
   }
   
   //--- print the array, 10 numbers per line.
   for (int g=0; g&lt;size; g =  g + __________) {
       if (g % 10 __________ 0) {
           cout &lt;&lt; endl;
       }
       cout &lt;&lt; setw(6) __________ bb[__________];
   }
   
   __________ 0;
}</pre>
</li>


<li class="question">(3 points) Translate this <b>for</b> loop into an equivalent <b>while</b> loop.
<pre>
   . . . 
   int power2 = 1;
   for (int i=0; i&lt;n; i++) {
       power2 *= power2;
   }
   cout &lt;&lt; power2;
   . . .
</pre>
</li>

<li>(3 points) Translate this <b>for</b> loop into an equivalent <b>while</b> loop.
<pre>
   . . . 
   int sum = 0;
   for (int i=n; i&gt;0; i--) {
       sum += i;
   }
   cout &lt;&lt; sum;
   . . .
</pre>
</li>


<li>(5 points) Write a program that reads two floating point numbers from the 
    input and prints their <b>average</b>.  You don't need a loop for this.
    Assume there are always two numbers in the input stream.
</li>


<li>(10 points) Write a program which reads a sequence of integers
    and counts how many times the number 55 occurs.  Print the count.
    For example, with input 55 25 1004 4 -6 55 0 55, the output
    should be <b>3</b> because there were 3 55's in the input stream.
    Your program should work for any input, not just this example.
</li>

<li>(15 points) Write a program which reads numbers, then prints
a parallelogram with edges that are that size.  For example,
when it reads the number 5, the output would be
<pre>
  *****
   *****
     *****
      *****
       *****
</pre>
Hint: If n is the number that is read in, there will be n rows of 
n stars.  Each successive row will have one more blank 
at the beginning.
</li>

<li class="question">(3 points) Translate this <b>switch</b> statement into equivalent <b>if</b> statements.
<pre>
   . . . 
   switch (xx) {
      case 1: cout &lt;&lt; "Hello";
              break;
      case 3: cout &lt;&lt; "Goodbye";
              break;
      default: cout &lt;&lt; "Never mind.";
   }
   . . .
</pre>
</li>

<li class="question">(5 points) Write a <b>program</b> that reads two numbers from the 
    input and prints their sum.  You don't need a loop for this.
    Assume there are always two numbers.
</li>


<li class="question">(10 points) Write a <b>program</b> to read a sequence of integers,
    ignoring all numbers that are less than 1.
    Count how many even and odd numbers there are, and print these
    counts.  For example, with input 7 25 100 2 -6 1 0 3, the output
    should be
    <pre>
    Even = 2, odd = 4</pre>
    There were two even numbers (100 and 2), four odd numbers (7, 25, 1, and 3),
    and two numbers were ignored (-6 and 0).  Your program should work for
    any input, not just this example.
</li>

<li class="question">(15 points) An expressway toll booth needs a program that tells how much
    to charge drivers.  The charge is based on how many people are
    in the vehicle.  To encourage car-pooling, the cost is lower
    for more people.  The cost is $6.00 for one person, 1/2 of that ($3.00)
    for two people, 1/3 ($2.00) for three people, and in general 1/n for n people.
    <br /><br />
    Write a program that reads the number of people in the vehicle and 
    prints the cost.  Print "ERROR" if a number less than 1 is entered.
    It continues reading input in a loop.
</li>
<li>(5 points) Read in a sequence of numbers and print them out in reverse.
    Do not use any functions for this problem.  Do use an array.
</li>

<li>(10 points) Write a function, countGreater, to count the number of values 
in an array that are larger than a specified floating=point value. The prototype is<pre>
   int countGreater(float val, float b[], int n);</pre>
where b is an array of n floating-point numbers b[0]..b[n-1], and val is the 
value you will compare against each of the array values.
Example call in the main program:<pre>
   float nums[] = {3.5, 1.0, 1.5};
   float wips[] = {2000., 300., -555, 0.0, 1.9999};
   int count = countGreater(1.0, nums, 3);
   cout &lt;&lt; count;  // would print 1
   count = countGreater(-33.3, wips, 5);
   cout &lt;&lt; count;  // would print 4
</pre>
</li>
   

<li>(10 points) Write a function to compute the average 
(sum of all values divided by the number of values)
of all the floating-point values in an array.
The function prototype is:<pre>
   float computeAvg(float b[], int n);</pre>
where b is an array of n floating-point values b[0]..b[n-1].  
The function should compute the average value in the b 
array and return that value.  Remember how you found
the maximum value when reading values from cin with a while loop.  Use the
same idea but go thru the array with a for loop.  If there are no values
in the array, return 0.0 .  Remember, this function will not do any I/O.
Example call in the main program:<pre>
   float nums[] = {3.5, 1.0, 1.5};
   float wips[] = {2000., 300., -555, 0.0, 1.9999};
   float av = computeAverage(nums, 3);
   cout &lt;&lt; av;  // would print 2.0
   av = computeAverage(wips, 5);
   cout &lt;&lt; av;  // would print 349.4
</pre>
</li>

<li>(10 points) Write a program to read a sequence of floating-point numbers and 
    print how many are greater than the average (mean) value.  
    Use the functions from the above two questions -- you can assume they're 
    written even if you didn't write them.
    To read the numbers, assume there is a readFloatArray function which reads
    input numbers into an array and returns the number of elements it read.
    <br />Prototypes of functions you can assume are already defined:
    <pre>
int readFloatArray(float a[]); // reads into a, returns num of elems
float computeAvg(float b[], int n); // average of b array
int countGreater(float val, float b[], int n); // counts elems > val
    </pre>
</li>

<li>(4 cancellation points) Extra credit.  You shouldn't try this program until you've done
    the others because it's harder, but worth fewer points!
    Any points on this question won't add to your
    total, but will be used to cancel out up to 4 points off on one of the 
    other program writing questions.
    <br />This is another variation on the bar graph program.  We had programs
    to print bar graphs with the base at the left.  Now try it so the base is at the bottom.
    
    <br /><br />You're going to have to save all the values in an array
    and figure out how many rows you'll have to
    print (the maximum value).  When you print each row, you'll have to make
    a decision at each column position to print either a blank (the bar in that 
    column has a lower
    value) or a star('*') if the bar for this column is greater or equal to 
    this row's "value".  Note that the subscripts in the array will correspond
    to a column in the output.
</li>
