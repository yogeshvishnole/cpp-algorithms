<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Expression Trees</h1>


<p>There are a many ways to write expressions: normal <i>infix</i> notation
using operator precedence and parentheses,
<i>prefix</i> (function) notation, <i>postfix</i> (reverse Polish, named after
the Polish mathematicial Lukasiewicz) notation, and as
<i>trees</i>. Trees are hard to represent in text-based writing 
systems, however, they are easy to use in a computer.
In computing diagrams of trees are most often written with the <i>root</i>
at the top.
</p>

<p>This example has +, -, and * operators
and integer operands.
</p>
<pre>
Normal infix notation: (7-5) * (3+(1-2))

Tree equivalent:
          *
         / \
        /   \
       -     +
      / \   / \
     #   # #   -
     7   5 3  / \
             #   #
             1   2
</pre>

Each node in the tree is represented as a struct/class,
with the following fields:
<ul>
<li>The operator, which can be encoded as a char variable.
    We'll represent integers with the special operator '#'
    and a field that contains the integer value.
    </li>
<li>The integer value.  This field is always there, but is
    only used with the '#' operator.
    </li>
<li>A pointer to the the left subtree if it's not the '#' operator
    (a terminal node).</li>
<li>A pointer to the right subtree as above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Processing trees can be done
in a nice, compact, natural, recursive manner.
</p>
