    <title>C++: sizeof operator</title>

<h1><a href="../index.html">C++</a>: sizeof operator</h1>

It's sometimes necessary to know how much memory is used for variables.
Because the C standard was written after there were C compilers,
the size of types was already different in different compilers and
on different machine architectures.  Therefore there is no single
definition of how big an int is, for example.

<p>If it's necessary to find out how much memory a type uses,
you can use the <code>sizeof</code> operator, which returns the 
amount of memory need in <b>bytes</b>. (8 bits per byte)   Altho it is
technically an operator, everyone writes it as if it was a
function.  For example,
<pre class="example">
  cout &lt;&lt; sizeof(int);
</pre>
would print 4 on many current compilers because that is the 
most common (Dev C++, MS Visual Studio, Borland C++Builder, gcc, ...).
In fact, many programs simply make some assumptions about the size
of variables.  It is common to assume they are 32, but if you want
to write for maximum portability, it is better to use sizeof.
</p>

<p>The single operand (argument) to sizeof is either a <i>type</i> or
a variable.
