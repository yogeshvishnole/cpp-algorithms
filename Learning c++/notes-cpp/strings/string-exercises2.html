<h1><a href="../index.html">C++</a>: C-Strings - Programming Exercises 2</h1>
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li class="question">No I/O (<code>cin</code> or <code>cout</code>) should be
    in these functions (other than temporary I/O for debugging purposes).
    As a general design principle, I/O should be restricted to a few functions
    which are specifically used for this purpose.  There is no need
    for I/O in these functions.
    </li>
<li class="question">There is no need for temporary arrays.
    The space in the arrays passed as parameters is sufficient.
    </li>
<li class="question">These functions can be written in either array-style or pointer-style.
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Programming Exercises</h2>

<ol>
<li class="question">Write a function to remove all trailing blanks from the <i>right</i> end of a string.
    Assume the prototype is
    <pre>    void trimRight(char a[]);</pre>
</li>

<li class="question">Write a function to remove all leading blanks from the <i>left</i> end of a string.
    Assume the prototype is
    <pre>    void trimLeft(char a[]);</pre>
</li>

<li class="question">Write a function to add extra blanks to the <i>right</i> end of a string to 
    make it at least length n.  If the string is already n characters or longer,
    do not change the string.  
    Assume the prototype is
    <pre>    void padRight(char a[], int n);</pre>
</li>

<li class="question">Write a function to add extra blanks to the <i>left</i> end of a string to 
    make it at least length n.  If the string is already n characters or longer,
    do not change the string.  
    Assume the prototype is
    <pre>    void padLeft(char a[], int n);</pre>
</li>

<li class="question">Write a function to center a string by adding blanks to the front and back.  
    If the string is already n characters or longer,
    do not change the string.  If an odd number of blanks have to be added,
    put the extra blank on the right.  You can use the functions in the
    previous problems (padRight and padLeft) to solve this problem.
    Assume the prototype is
    <pre>    void center(char a[], int n);</pre>
</li>

<li class="question">Write a function which returns true if the string parameter
    is a <i>palindrome</i>.  A palindrome is any "word" which is the same
    forward and backward, eg, "radar", "noon", "20011002", ...  The function should return
    false if the argument is not a palindrome.  
    Assume the prototype is
    <pre>    bool isPalindrome(char a[]);</pre>
</li>

<li class="question">Write a function which shortens a string to n characters.  If the string is 
    already shorter than n, the function should not change the string.
    Assume the prototype is
    <pre>    void truncate(char a[], int n);</pre>
</li>

<li class="question">Write a function which capitalizes the first letter in every word.
    Assume the first letter is any letter at the beginning or preceded
    by a blank.  All other letters should be turned into lowercase.
    You can use the library toupper and tolower functions.
    Assume the prototype is
    <pre>    void capitalizeWords(char a[]);</pre>
</li>


<li class="question">Write a function, <code>capitalize</code>, which
    changes the first letter of the argument string
    to uppercase.  You can use the library <code>toupper</code>
    function which works on one char.  Note that the 
    <code>toupper</code> function returns a value without
    changing its parameter.
    Assume the prototype is
<pre>    void capitalize(char a[]);</pre>
</li>

<li class="question">Write a function, <code>isAlpha</code>, which
    returns true if all characters in the parameter
    are alphabetic (ie, if there are no non-alphabetic characters), 
    and false otherwise.  You can use the library <code>isalpha</code>
    function to test the individual characters.  If there are no
    characters in the argument, this function should succeed.
    Assume the prototype is
<pre>    bool isAlpha(char a[]);</pre>
</li>

<li class="question">Write a function, <code>reverse</code>, which
    reverses the characters in the argument.
    Assume the prototype is
<pre>    void reverse(char a[]);</pre>
</li>

<li class="question">Write a function, <code>count</code>, which
    counts the occurrences in the first argument, a,
    of the single character which is the second argument, c.
    Assume the prototype is
<pre>    int count(char a[], char c);</pre>
For example,
<pre>    i = count("abracadabra", 'a');</pre> would return 5.
</li>

<li class="question">Write a function, <code>count</code>, which
    counts the occurrences in the first argument, a,
    of the characters in the second argument, b.
    Assume the prototype is
<pre>    int count(char a[], char b[]);</pre>
For example,
<pre>    i = count("abracadabra", "bax");</pre> would return 7.
</li>

<li class="question">Write a function, <code>deleteChar</code>, which
    deletes any occurrence in the first argument, a,
    of the single character which is the second argument, c.
    Assume the prototype is
<pre>void deleteChar(char a[], char c);</pre>
</li>
