<h2>Strings</h2>
There are two ways to represent character strings in C++.
<ol>
<li><b>Arrays of characters</b>, terminated by a "zero" value, are commonly used.
    These are referred to as &quot;c-strings&quot; to distinguish them from the
    <code>string</code> type that was introduced in the C++ Standard Template Library.</li>
<li>The <b><code>string</code> class</b> is a relatively late addition to C++ that 
    represents strings as objects.  This class is generally easier to use than
    c-strings, but you usually can not avoid some use of c-strings.
    </li>
</ol>


<h2>Characters</h2>
Individual characters (type <code>char</code>) are stored in single bytes.
A character literal is surrounded by single quotes (eg, 'a', ')', ...).
Double quotes are used to represent a c-string literal.  Eg, &quot;a&quot; is a
c-string consisting of one character followed by a zero.
Some characters need to be preceded by
a special <i>escape character</i> (the backslash), because they have some
meaning to the compiler.
For example, '\'' is a single quote, '\\' is a single backslash,  
'\n' is the <i>newline</i> character, and there are others.


<h2>Arrays of Characters terminated with &quot;zero&quot;</h2>
C-strings are stored as characters in an array.  Following 
the characters there is a character with
code zero.  You can write this as either 0 or '\0'.  The
name for this ASCII character is NUL, but that should not 
be confused with the special pointer value NULL (which should
not be used for this purpose).


<h2>Quoted Strings</h2>
A double-quoted string of characters is a common way to write an array of 
characters.  The string <code>"Hello"</code> represents and array of
<b>six</b> (not 5) characters.  The last character is the terminating
zero code.  Example,
<pre class="fragment">
char greeting[] = &quot;Hello&quot;;</pre>
is the same as
<pre class="fragment">
char greeting[6] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};</pre>
   
   
<h2>Using a quoted string as an array</h2>
A quoted string really represents an array, so it can even be subscripted.  For example,
<pre class="fragment">
for (int i=0; i&lt;5; i++) {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello&quot;[i];
}</pre>


<h2>Include files</h2>
If you are using the c-string  and character functions, you must have
<br/>
<table summary=""><tr><td>
<pre class="fragment">
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
#include &lt;cctype&gt;</pre>
</td>
<td>or for old compilers</td>
<td>
<pre class="fragment">
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;</pre>
</td></tr></table>
