<h1><a href="../../index.html">C++</a>: Arrays: Programming Problem: Sort Students</h1>
Name __________________________________

<p>(5 points) Read lines of information about students and their scores on
   on a test.  Sort this information <i>by score</i>, and print a new list
   of scores and students with this information.
   </p>
Specifications and Implementation.
<ul>
<li style="margin-top:1em"><b>Input data</b>.
A few sample lines of the input data might look like the following, with
a test score followed by a first name followed by a last name.

   <pre>
   74 JOHN SMITH
   95 JILL SMITH
   87 BILLY JONES</pre>
   </li>
<li style="margin-top:1em">The <b>maximum number</b> of students that will be read, until an EOF,
    is 1000 (ie, the maximum array size).
    </li>
<li style="margin-top:1em"><b>Types</b>.  The score is an <code>int</code>,
    and each of the names should be a <code>string</code>. 
    Do not use C-strings (char arrays) for the names because they are difficult
    to use in arrays.
    </li>
<li style="margin-top:1em"><b>Parallel arrays</b> or <b>structs</b>.
    This data will have to be read into arrays and sorted.
    There are two general approaches.
    <ul>
    <li>Three arrays can be used, one for scores, one for first names,
        and one for last names.  If this approach is used, any exchanges
        in the sorting process must exchange the corresponding elements
        the all three arrays.
        </li>
    <li>A struct can be defined that holds all three values.  For example,
        <pre class="fragment">
struct Student {
          string first_name;
          string last_name;
          int    score;
       };</pre>
       Then a single array of Student structs can be used.
       This is a better approach, but use parallel arrays if you don't feel comfortable
       with structs yet.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    
<li style="margin-top:1em"><b>Sort algorithm</b>.
    Use either a bubble sort of a selection sort.
    The selection sort is a little more efficient because
    the number of exchanges is smaller.
    </li>
    
<li style="margin-top:1em"><b>Implementation strategy</b>.
    Try using good <i>iterative development</i> techniques.
    Implement the program in stages.  
    Compile and test each stage before continuing.
    For example, 
    <ol>
    <li>Write a main that does nothing except return.</li>
    <li>Add some arrays and read into them.</li>
    <li>Write out the arrays.</li>
    <li>Once you can read and write the arrays correctly,
        write a sort function.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    
<li style="margin-top:1em"><b>Sample output</b> for the sample input.
   <pre>
   74 JOHN SMITH
   87 BILLY JONES
   95 JILL SMITH</pre>
   Of course, you should test it with much more data.
   </li>
</ul>
