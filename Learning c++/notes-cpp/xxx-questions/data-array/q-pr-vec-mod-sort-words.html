    <title>Modify and Sort Words</title>

<h1>Modify and Sort Words</h1>

<p>Read a sequence of words, eliminate all vowels ("aeiou", lower case only)
if the resulting word would have at least two characters, otherwise don't eliminate
any vowels.  Sort and print the words.
</p>

<p>The modification of each word should be made by calling a void function, compressWord,
where the word is the single parameter.  
<i>This function must be defined in a separate file</i>.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Input</dt>
   <dd>
   <pre>
    This is the test data for a 
    first run.</pre>
   </dd>
   
<dt>Output</dt>
   <dd>
   <pre>
    Ths
    a
    dt
    fr
    frst
    is
    rn.
    th
    tst</pre>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
<li><i>vector</i>.  There is no bound on the number of words, so use an appropriate
    data structure.  I recommend <code>vector</code>.  
    I you're not familiar with it, you can find a short description starting on p 102 of the
    textbook.
    </li>
    
<li><i>string</i>.  Another STL class that will be useful is <i>string</i>.
    There is a little information in the textbook about it.  Some additional
    features you could use are (assuming <code>string s = "abcdef";</code>).
    <ul>
    <li>You can use the subscription operator to access individual characters.
        <code>s[4]</code> is 'e'.</li>
    <li>You can delete substrings using <i>erase</i>.  
        For example, after <code>s.erase(4, 1)</code>, the value in s is "abcdf".
        </li>
    </ul>
    You can find additional string notes at
    <a href="http://www.msoe.edu/eecs/ce/courseinfo/stl/string.htm">ANSI String Class</a>.
    </li>
    
<li><i>cin, cout</i>.  Use the standard IO streams for the input and output.
    <i>cin</i> works nicely with strings to read "words", strings of non-whitespace 
    characters.  Don't worry about real text problems like case and 
    the fact that punctuation will be included in the words.
    </li>
    
<li><i>sort</i>.  You don't have to write your own sort; in fact it's a
    bad idea to do so (bugs, inefficiency).  Use the STL <i>sort</i>
    function.  For example.
    <pre>
    vector&lt;string&gt; words;
    . . .
    sort(words.begin(), words.end());</pre>
    </li>
    
<li><i>Iterative programming</i>.  Use iterative programming.  Start with a 
    very small program (main that does nothing), test it, add a feature, test
    it, and continue making small additions and testing.  This style is 
    usually effective in making your programming go faster with fewer bugs.
    </li>
    
</ul>
