<p>(5 points) Write a program to read in a year (int) and print
whether it is a leap year or not.  Read using a <code>cin</code> loop.
</p>

<p>The Earth refuses to revolve
around the Sun in an integer number of days.  To adjust the 
number of days in our calendar to approximate the year, 
extra days are inserted from time to time.  The rules for
when to add February 29 are the following.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The year is divisible by four (eg, 1980, 1984, 2004).
    This does a good job, but the calendar years are now a little too long on the average, 
    so the following adjustment is made to omit some leap years.</li>
<li>It's not a leap year if it's divisible by 100.  Altho 1800 is divisible by
    four, it divisible by 100, so it isn't a leap year.  
    Much better approximation, but now the the average year is just
    a little bit too short.  so another adjustment has to be made.</li>
<li>It is a leap year, even if it is divisible by 100,
    if it's divisible by 400.  So 1800 and 1900 (divisible by 100) 
    were not leap years, 
    but 2000 (divisible by 400) was a leap year.
    This is now so close that it will be 60,000 years before the
    calendar is off by one day.</li>
</ol>
