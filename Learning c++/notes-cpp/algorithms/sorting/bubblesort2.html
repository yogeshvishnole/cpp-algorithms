<h1><a href="../../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Algorithms: More Bubble Sorts</h1>

Here are some additional variations on bubble sort.
   

<h2>Bubble Sort -- stop when no exchanges</h2>

   This version of bubble sort continues making passes over 
   the array as long as there were any exchanges.  
   If the array is already sorted, this sort will stop after only
   one pass.
   <pre class="example">
 void bubbleSort2(int x[], int n) {
    bool exchanges;
    do {
       exchanges = false;  // assume no exchanges
       for (int i=0; i&lt;n-1; i++) {
          if (x[i] &gt; x[i+1]) {
             int temp = x[i]; x[i] = x[i+1]; x[i+1] = temp;
             exchanges = true;  // after exchange, must look again
          }
       }
    } while (exchanges);
 }</pre>
   
   Disadvantage: This algorithm doesn't shorten the
   range each time by 1 as it could.  See below.
  
  
<h2>Bubble Sort -- stop when no exchanges, shorter range each time</h2>

   This version of bubble sort combines ideas from the previous versions.
   It stops when there are no more exchanges, and it also sorts a smaller
   range each time.
   <pre class="example">
void bubbleSort3(int x[], int n) {
  bool exchanges;
  do {
    n--;               // make loop smaller each time.
    exchanges = false; // assume this is last pass over array
    for (int i=0; i&lt;n; i++) {
      if (x[i] &gt; x[i+1]) {
        int temp = x[i];  x[i] = x[i+1];  x[i+1] = temp;
        exchanges = true;  // after an exchange, must look again 
      }
    }
  } while (exchanges);
}</pre>
   
   Disadvantage: After the first pass it may not be necessary to examine the
   entire range of the array -- only from where the lowest exchange occurred
   to where the highest exchange occurred.  The parts above and below must
   already be sorted.  See below.
   

<h2>Bubble Sort -- Sort only necessary range</h2>

Here's a version of bubble sort that, on each pass, looks only at the
region of array where more exchanges might be necessary.

//========================================================= bubbleSortRange
// After a pass in bubble sort, it's only necessary to sort from just 
// below the first exchange (small values may move lower)
// to just before the last exchange (largest values won't move higher). 
// Everything that wasn't exchanged must be in the correct order. 
// After each pass, the upper and lower bounds for the next pass are
// set from the positions of the first and last exchanges on prev pass.

void bubbleSortRange(int x[], int n) {
    int lowerBound = 0;    // First position to compare.
    int upperBound = n;    // First position NOT to compare.
  
    //--- Continue making passes while there is a potential exchange.
    while (lowerBound &lt;= upperBound) {
        int firstExchange = n;  // assume impossibly high index for low end.
        int lastExchange  = -1; // assume impossibly low index for high end.
        
        //--- Make a pass over the appropriate range.
        for (int i=lowerBound; i&lt;upperBound; i++) {
            if (x[i] &gt; x[i+1]) {
                //--- exchange elements
                int temp = x[i];  x[i] = x[i+1];  x[i+1] = temp;
                //--- Remember first and last exchange indexes.
                if (i&lt;firstExchange) { // true only for first exchange.
                    firstExchange = i;
                }
                lastExchange = i;
            }
        }
        
        //--- Prepare limits for next pass.
        lowerBound = firstExchange-1;
        if (lowerBound &lt; 0) {
            lowerBound = 0;
        }
        upperBound = lastExchange;
    }
}//end bubbleSortRange
</pre></div>

   Disadvantage: Notice that the largest unsorted element will always be moved all the
   way to its correct position in the array, but small elements are shifted down
   by only one place on each pass.

<h2>Other bubble sorts</h2>
Note that in all these sorts the part that is sorted grows at only one end
of the array.  The ability to quit early is not symmetrical.  The extreme
values move all the way to the end in one direction, but only one place in
the other direction.  The algorithm can be improved by alternately "bubbling" in
opposite directions.
