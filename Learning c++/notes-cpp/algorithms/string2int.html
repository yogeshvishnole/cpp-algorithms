<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Example: C-String to Int</h1>

<h2>Converting C-Strings to Integer</h2>
<p>If you want to convert a C-string (zero-terminated array of chars) of digits,
you can call one of the library functions to do this (good idea), or
write something like the following (good exercise).
</p>

<h2>Character codes for digits</h2>
<p>Every character is represented by a pattern of bits.  These patterns can be
thought of as integers.  If your system uses ASCII (or any of the
newer standards), the integer value of the code for '0' is 48,
'1' is 49, etc.  This knowledge is commonly used when converting character digits
to their equivalent values.
</p>

<h2>Example function to convert C-strings to int</h2>
<p>One of the problems to solve immediately is what to do with errors.
Let's make this a bool function that returns true if we can convert the string
(eg, no illegal characters), and false otherwise.  We'll pass the value back in
a reference parameter.
</p>


<h2>The code</h2>
                        
<pre class="file">
//============================================== string2int
bool string2int(char* digit, int&amp; result) {
   result = 0;

   //--- Convert each digit char and add into result.
   while (*digit &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; *digit &lt;='9') {
      result = (result * 10) + (*digit - '0');
      digit++;
   }

   //--- Check that there were no non-digits at end.
   if (*digit != 0) {
      return false;
   }

   return true;
}
</pre>

<h3>How compact should your code be?</h3>
<p>A shorter, but perhaps less readable, version can replace the last
three statements to return the correct bool value.
Recent compilers should produce equivalently efficient code,
so the most important thing is to choose the most readable 
version.  In general try to resist making programs shorter without
improving their clarity.  The following is plausible, and may be 
more readable.</p>
<pre class="example">
   return *digit == 0;   // true if at end of string.</pre>
   
<p>A more extreme shortening is definitely NOT more readable.</p>
<div class="file"><pre>
bool s2i(char*d,int&amp;r){for(r=0;*d&gt;='0'&amp;&amp;*d&lt;='9';r=r*10+*(d++)-'0');return*d==0;}
</pre></div>



<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>Extend this to take an initial '-' sign for negative numbers.
    Hint: One way to do this is to check for it at the beginning and
    set a number to either -1 or 1.  Then at the end multiply by this
    number.
    </li>
    
<li>Convert this to convert doubles (<tt>string2double(...)</tt>).  After the integer portion check
    for a '.'.  Then loop over all the remaining digits, multiplying
    the first by 0.1, the second by 0.01, the third by 0.001, etc. and
    adding them to the result.
    </li>
    
<li>Make sure there is at least one digit.
    </li>
    
<li>Add a range check.  Perhaps the simplest way to do this is to convert it 
    into a double, then check the range of the double.</li>
    
</ol>
