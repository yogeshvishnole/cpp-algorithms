<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Dynamic Allocation of Arrays</h1>

<h2>The problems with fixed size arrays</h2>
<p>Declaring an array with a fixed size like
</p>
<pre class="example">
int a[100000];</pre>
<p>has two typical problems: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Exceeding maximum</b>. 
    Choosing a real maximum is often impossible because the programmer has
    no control over the size of the data sets the user is interested in.
    Erroneous assumptions that a maximum will never be exceeded are the
    source of many programming bugs.
    Declaring very large arrays can be extremely 
    wasteful of memory, and if there are many such arrays, may
    prevent the program from running in some systems.</li>
<li><b>No expansion</b>. Using a small size may be more efficient for the typical data set, 
    but prevents the
    program from running with larger data sets.  If array limits are
    not checked, large data sets will run over the end of an array with
    disastrous consequences.  Fixed size arrays can not expand as needed.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>These problems can be avoided by dynamically
allocating an array of the right size, or reallocating an array when it
needs to expand.  Both of these are done by declaring an array as a 
pointer and using the <code><b>new</b></code> operator to allocate memory,
and <code><b>delete</b></code> to free memory that is no longer needed.
</p>

<p>This is exactly what is <code><a href="../stl-containers/vector/vector.html">vector</a></code>
does, but let's see how it's done with an array.</p>

<h2>Declare array as a pointer, allocate with <code>new</code></h2>
<p>To create a variable that will point to a dynamically allocated
array, declare it as a pointer to the element type.
For example,
</p>
<pre class="example">
int* a = NULL;  // pointer to an int, intiallly to nothing.
</pre>
<p>A dynamically allocated array is declared as a pointer, and must not
use the fixed array size declaration.
The above declaration creates a pointer, but doesn't yet allocate
any memory to it.
</p>

<h2>Allocate an array with code>new</h2>
<p>When the desired size of an array is known, allocate memory for it
with the <code><b>new</b></code> operator and save the address of that memory
in the pointer.  Remember: <i>Pointers may be subscripted just as arrays are.</i>
The example below reads in a number and allocates that size array.
</p>

<pre class="example">
<span class="hilite">int* a</span> = NULL;   // Pointer to int, initialize to nothing.
int n;           // Size needed for array
cin &gt;&gt; n;        // Read in the size
<span class="hilite">a = <b>new</b> int[n]</span>;  // Allocate n ints and save ptr in a.
for (int i=0; i&lt;n; i++) {
    a[i] = 0;    // Initialize all elements to zero.
}
. . .  // Use a as a normal array
<span class="hilite">delete [] a</span>;  // When done, free memory pointed to by <i>a</i>.
a = NULL;     // Clear a to prevent using invalid memory reference.
</pre>
   
<h2>Freeing memory with delete</h2>
<p>When you are finished with dynamically allocated memory, <i>free</i> it
with the <b>delete</b> operator.  After memory is freed, it can be 
reused by later <code>new</code> requests.  Memory that your program didn't free
will be freed when the program terminates.  Never free memory that
wasn't dynamically allocated - the results are unpredictable.
</p>
<pre class="example">
delete [] a;  // Free memory allocated for the <i>a</i> array.
a = NULL;     // Be sure the deallocated memory isn't used.
</pre>
   
<h3>Use <code>[]</code> when deleting arrays</h3>
<p>You must specify "<code>[]</code>"
when deleting an array, but not for a single value. 
It isn't possible to delete only part of an array.
</p>

<h3>Do you have to reset a pointer after delete?</h3>
<p>Following the <code>delete</code> in these examples, I reset the pointer to <code>NULL</code>.
This isn't strictly necessary, but it's very good practice so that any use
of the pointer will produce an error.  Attempts to use memory location 0, which
is the normal default value of <code>NULL</code>, will be blocked by the
way most operating systems allocate memory.
</p>
<p>Why doesn't <code>delete</code> reset the pointer?  It does in some systems,
but the language specification does not require it, so not all systems do it.
</p>
