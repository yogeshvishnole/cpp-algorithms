<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Dynamic Alloc. Issues</h1>

   
<h2>Memory leaks</h2>
<p>A program that
allocates memory, but doesn't free it,
is said to have a <i>memory leak</i>.  For a small amount of data this usually
isn't a big problem.  However, a program that runs for a long time repeatedly
allocating memory without freeing it will eventually crash, often crashing
the entire system.
</p>


<h2>Dangling pointers</h2>
<p><i>Dangling</i> or <i>stale</i> pointers are another source of problems.
These are pointers to memory that has been deallocated.  There's no problem
in principle with leaving old pointers lying around, as long as they're never used.
It's good practice to set pointer to NULL immediately after a <i>delete</i> so
there is no possibility of using them again.
</p>


<h2>Dynamic allocation expansion policy</h2>
<p>There is some (usually a very small percentage of the total cpu time) overhead 
in dynamically allocating memory.  The <i>policy</i> on how big each expansion
should be is important to efficiency.
A common policy for array expansion is to double the size each time.
One could, in principle,
allocate one one extra element each time it the array was expanded, but this
would be too inefficient.  D
Altho it is commonly used, there is no magic in doubling -- it might be more appropriate for a particular 
application to add a fixed increment.
