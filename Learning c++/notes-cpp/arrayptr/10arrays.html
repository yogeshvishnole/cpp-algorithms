<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Arrays</h1>

<h2>Many values, one name</h2>
<p>An array stores many values in memory using one name, 
and individual values are identified by number.
Unlike math, arrays must be <i>declared</i> and
a <i>fixed</i> amount of memory must be <i>allocated</i>
for them.
</p>
      
<p>Individual elements are identified by integer subscripts which
are enclosed in square brackets <code>[]</code> following the array variable.
<code>x<sub>i</sub></code> in mathematics is written as
<strong><b><code>x[i]</code></b></strong> in C++ and most other programming languages.
</p>
   
<p>Arrays are the basic underlying mechanism for storing multiple values, and
many additional ways to store values are built on them, especially in the
<i>Standard Template Library</i> (STL).  A solid understanding of arrays is
essential, even tho you will want to use some of STL library data structures.
</p>
<p>
In general, you should use arrays only for storing a fixed number of elements,
and <a href="../stl-containers/vector/header-vector.html">vectors</a> when storing a variable number of elements.
This section is about arrays, so it uses them in all examples, even
when there are better choices (esp, <code>vector</code>).
</p>
      
        
<h2>Declaring an array</h2>
   Array <i>size</i> and element <i>type</i> must be declared.  
   All elements must be the same type, eg, all <code>int</code> or all <code>char</code>.  Write the
   element type name, the name of the array variable, then the size
   enclosed in square brackets ("<code>[]</code>").
 <pre class="example">
int scores[100];  // 100 ints, scores[0] to scores[99]
char name[40];    // 40 chars, name[0] to name[39]</pre>
   

<h2>Subscripts start at zero</h2>
   Subscript ranges always start at zero.
   This is unfriendly because it isn't the way that 
   humans normally count, but it's the way that C, C++, Java 
   and many other languages do it.
   
   
<h2>Length of an array</h2>
   There is no general way to find the length of an array.  You must keep the
   size (both the maximum, and currently filled size) of the array in variables.
   For example,
<pre class="example">
const int MAXSIZE = 366;
...
int temperature[MAXSIZE];
int numOfTemps = 0;  // Number of entries in temperature.
</pre>
   
   
<h2>Arrays are to data what loops are to control flow</h2>
<p>Loops and arrays go together.  This example
sets all array elements to zero.
</p>
<pre class="fragment">
float height[1000];
. . .
for (int i=0; i&lt;1000; i++) {
    height[i] = 0.0;
}</pre>


<h2>Operations on arrays</h2>
<p>Very few operations are legal for arrays.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>No assignment</i>.  Use a loop to copy elements from one array to another.</li>
<li><i>No comparisons</i>.  Use a loop to compare elements of two arrays.</li>
<li><i>No arithmetic operations</i>.  Use a loop to perform arithmetic
                 operations between two arrays.</li>
<li><i>Subscription</i> is one of the few operations that can be applied
                   to arrays.  Because arrays are like pointers, the pointer
                   operations are legal, but those aren't covered here.</li>
</ul>
