    <title>C++ Notes: 2-D Array Memory Layout</title>

<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: 2-D Array Memory Layout</h1>
 
<h2>Two kinds of multi-dimensional arrays.</h2>
   There are two basic ways of implementing 2-dimensional arrays:
   <i>rectangular, sequential, two-dimensional arrays</i> and <i>arrays of arrays</i>.
   Some languages use one method, some another, and some both.  C++ allows
   both methods, and each has its advantages and disadvantages.
   <ul>
   <li><b>rectangular sequential arrays</b>.  In this case the rows are laid out
       sequentially in memory.  This provides simplicity in memory management
       and a slight speed advantage.  This is the kind of array C/C++ creates
       by default.
       </li>
   <li><b>Arrays of arrays</b>.  In this style each element of a one-dimensional array
       is a <i>pointer</i> to another array.  
       This is a common way to create an 
       array of C-strings (a zero-terminated array of characters).
       This is also useful if the rows are uneven length or are
       dynamically allocated.  The disadvantage is that memory management 
       is more complex, often requiring dynamic allocation and deallocation.
       This is the only kind of multi-dimensional array in Java.
       See <a href="24arraysofarrays.html">Arrays of Arrays</a>.
       </li>
   </ul>
   

<h2>Rectangular arrays allocated in memory by row</h2>
<table border="0">
<tr valign="top"><td>
Let's see how the memory is allocated for this array.
<pre class="example">
char ttt[3][3] = {{'x', 'x', 'o'},
                  {'o', 'o', 'x'},
                  {'x', 'o', ' '}
                 };
</pre>
<p>The memory for this array could be visualized as in the diagram to the right, which 
identifies a few cells by their subscripts.</p>
</td><td valign="top">
<div align="center">
<img alt="2D array memory representation" src="2d-arrays-1-312x183.gif" width="312" height="183" />
</div>
</td></tr></table>

<table border="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td>
<div align="center">
<img alt="2D array memory representation" src="2d-arrays-2-375x105.gif" width="375" height="105" />
</div>
</td>
<td>
<p>Because memory is addressed linearly, a better representation 
is like the diagram to the left.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>



<h2>Computing the address of an array element</h2>
C++ must compute the memory address of each
array element that it accesses.  C++ does this automatically,
but it helps to understand what's going
on "under the hood".  Assume the following declaration:
<pre class="example">
char a[ROWS][COLS];  // assume ROWS and COLS are const ints
</pre>
Because arrays are laid out in memory by row, each <i>row length</i>
is COLS (the number of columns is the size of a row).  Let's assume
that you want to find the address of <code>a[r][c]</code>.
The <i>baseAddress</i> of the array is the address of the first element.
The <i>rowSize</i> is <code>COLS</code> in the above example.
The <i>elementSize</i> is the number of bytes required to represent the
data (typically 1 for <code>char</code>, 4 for <code>int</code>,
4 for <code>float</code>, and 8 for <i>double</i>.
<pre>
   <i>address</i> = <i>baseAddress</i> + <i>elementSize</i> * (r*<i>rowSize</i> + c);
</pre>
Note
<ul>
<li>The number of rows (<code>ROWS</code>) is not used in the computation.</li>
<li>Because the number of rows is not used, there is no need to pass it 
    when declaring a formal array parameter for a two-dimension array.</li>
</ul>
