<h2>Spolsky on pointers</h2>
"Understanding pointers in C is not a skill, it's an aptitude. 
In Freshman year CompSci, there are always about 200 kids at the beginning of 
the semester, all of whom wrote complex adventure games in BASIC for their 
Atari 800s when they were 4 years old. They are having a good old time learning 
Pascal in college, until one day their professor introduces pointers, 
and suddenly, they don't get it. They just don't understand anything any more. 
90% of the class goes off and becomes PoliSci majors, then they tell their friends 
that there weren't enough good looking members of the appropriate sex in their 
CompSci classes, that's why they switched. For some reason most people seem to be 
born without the part of the brain that understands pointers. 
This is an aptitude thing, not a skill thing ­ it requires a complex form of 
doubly-indirected thinking that some people just can't do."

<h2>But ...</h2>
I don't agree with this; understanding pointers is a skill
that can be learned.  
It's easy if you start programming in assembly language
since the way pointers work is immediately clear.  However, assembly language is
rarely taught now, as is appropriate. And C makes pointers a little harder
than they need be.  What the quote does illustrate is that there is a conceptual
step that has to be made when learning pointers; some make it more easily than
others.  
This is aggravated by poor explanations of pointers in some textbooks.  
90% dropout is ridiculous.  If you're having trouble with pointers, keep with 
it.  Once you get the idea, it will seem quite clear.
