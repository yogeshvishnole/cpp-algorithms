<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Switch usage</h1>


<h2>When to use <code>switch</code> instead of <code>if</code>?</h2>
The <code>if</code> statement is used most frequently.
However, when a single integral value (<code>char</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, 
<code>long</code>) is used to select from
many possibilities, it is better to use
<code>switch</code> because the source code is simpler, and therefore 
the chance of writing an erroneous comparison is less and the code
is easier to read and therefore maintain.  


<h2>The <code>break</code> problem</h2>
The <code>break</code> statement at the end of the each <code>switch</code> clause is 
a major source of errors because it is easy to forget and C++ won't complain.
Execution simply continues with the next case.  Java was
criticized for using adopting the C++ switch statement without fixing this
problem.  C# has fixed this by making the defualt action at the end of a case to break,
and requiring the <code>continue</code> keyword for the unusual case of falling into
the next case.

<h2>Indenting and spacing <code>switch</code> statements</h2>
<p>
A typical <code>switch</code> statement uses two levels of indentation:
the <code>case</code> keyword is indented one level, and the statements
in a case are indented an additional level.
</p>

<p><i>Single, short statements</i> may be written on the same line as the case.
</p>

<p>Add blank lines after <code>break</code> statements if that 
makes the code more readable.
</p>


<h2><code>break</code> after last case</h2>
Altho there is no need to put a <code>break</code> after the last
case, it is good practice so that it isn't forgotten when addition
cases are added.  Exception: <code>default</code>, if used, should be 
the last case and there doesn't need to be a <code>break</code>
because nothing will ever be added after it.
