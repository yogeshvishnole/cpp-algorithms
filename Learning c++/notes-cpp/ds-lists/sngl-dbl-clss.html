<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: From linear singly linked lists to <i>list</i> class</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The history of linked lists is long, with many implementation variations.
Early lists often concentrated on economical use of memory (eg, single links).
Bidirectional lists became the standard as memory prices dropped, and as 
OOP because the standard, the C++ STD <i>list</i> and Java <i>LinkedList</i> classes
have replaced hand-made lists and replaced the link implementation details 
with iterators.
</p>
<p>Linked lists are favorite topics of textbooks, and really wonderful exercises
for learning to work with pointers, but don't even think about using your own
lists.  Use the library lists instead.
</p>

<h2>Singly linked lists</h2>
<p>When memory was scarce, small data structures were 
critically important.  It's still important, but if using a little extra 
memory can be used to make algorithms easier, it's worth it.
Some problems with singly-linked lists:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Unable to delete a node giving a pointer to it.</li>
<li>Unable in insert in front of pointer to a node.</li>
<li>Unable to move backwards easily.</li>
<li>It may require moving down the entire list to get to the end.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Circular singly linked lists</h2>
<p>If the last element is linked to the first, the entire list
forms a ring, there are no longer any special end cases.  The "end" of the list
is when you get back to the starting point.  This eliminates
the concept of front and back of the list, which may or may not be an advantage.</p>

<h2>Doubly linked lists</h2>
<p>A solution to the above problems is to add an extra link in to the previous
element in each node.  The memory cost is generally considered worth the 
convenience it buys.  A node might be declared as follows (non-OOP):
</p>

<pre class="fragment">
// Node for doubly linked list of floats.
struct Node {
    Node* next;  // Pointer to next element
    Node* prev;  // Pointer to previous element
    float data;
};</pre>

<p>The common operations of inserting and deleting become easy.
There are still some problems that remain.  
</p>
<ul>
<li>The ends present special cases in insertion and deletion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Circular doubly linked lists</h2>
<p>Doubly linked lists still have end point problems that can be solved
but making them circular.
Problems still remain.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The empty list can be an annoying special case.</li>
<li>Updating the front (head) or back (tail) of a list pose serious problems
    if the code is executed several call invocations away.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Circular doubly linked lists with dummy node</h2>
<p>The advantage of a dummy node is that there is a reference point to identify 
the front and back.
</p>
<p>Secondly, there is something in the list even when the list
is empty.  The advantage of this may not be immediately obvious,
but having a pointer to this dummy element represent the list 
allows list manipulations to take place without having to store back
into this pointer.
</p>

<h2>OOP - list class and iterators</h2>
<p>Lists are represented by an object that contains little more than
a pointer to the list elements.  You might think of it as a pointer
to a dummy node in a circular doubly linked list.  
The beauty of OOP is that the implementation can be completely hidden
Movement around the list uses an <i>iterator</i>, which hides
the implementation details of the node and pointers.
