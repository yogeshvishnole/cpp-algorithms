    <title>C++ Notes: Graphical User Interfaces</title>
</head>

<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Graphical User Interfaces</h1>
<p>There are hundreds of packages to use in creating GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces).
Every proprietary operating system has one or more proprietary GUI library.  In these notes
I'll just mention Microsoft Windows, but something similar applies to MacOS, OS/2, etc.
In addition to the many proprietary GUI packages, there are a number of popular
portable GUI libraries.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Microsoft Windows.  I'm not interested in system lock-in, so I don't
    pay much attention to these.  However, the following are available.
    <ul>
    <li>MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) has been used in Microsoft Windows
        systems for a long time.  Ugly and difficult, but of course it runs
        on a lot of systems.
        </li>
    <li>The new .NET GUI system.  I don't remember the name, but I've seen some 
        of the things that are coming up in the Longhorn edition, and I was very
        impressed, eg, by XAML.  But not portable, of course.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
<li>Portable (at least between Windows, Linux, and MacOSX).  Here are some of the more popular systems.

    <p><b>Overview</b>. Read <a href="http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/928/">GUI Toolkits for The X Window System</a> 
    for an (old) overview of the these (and more).
    I've used FLTK, but it seems to be replaced by eFLTK, which I haven't checked out.
    I'd probably start with wxWidgets, but ...

             They use the DOS window, VIM, and nmake for development instead of Dev-C++, but
             the programs are the same.</li>
