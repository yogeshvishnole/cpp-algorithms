<h2>Spolsky on pointers</h2>
<p>"Understanding pointers in C is not a skill, it's an aptitude. 
In Freshman year CompSci, there are always about 200 kids at the beginning of 
the semester, all of whom wrote complex adventure games in BASIC for their 
Atari 800s when they were 4 years old. They are having a good old time learning 
Pascal in college, until one day their professor introduces pointers, 
and suddenly, they don't get it. They just don't understand anything any more. 
90% of the class goes off and becomes PoliSci majors, then they tell their friends 
that there weren't enough good looking members of the appropriate sex in their 
CompSci classes, that's why they switched. For some reason most people seem to be 
born without the part of the brain that understands pointers. 
This is an aptitude thing, not a skill thing ­ it requires a complex form of 
doubly-indirected thinking that some people just can't do."

<h2>But ...</h2>
<p>Normally Joel Spolsky's editorials are good, but this one is completely wrong.  
Understanding pointers is a skill
that can easily be learned, as I can personally attest to having taught pointers 
to many hundreds of students.
It's easy if you start programming in assembly language
because the way pointers work is immediately clear.  However, assembly language is
rarely taught now (as is appropriate). 
What the quote does illustrate is that there is a conceptual
step that has to be made when learning pointers; some make it more easily than
others.</p>
<p>
Pointers are made more difficult by poor explanations of pointers in some textbooks.  
90% dropout is a ridiculous exaggeration.  
In the past the enrollment in many computer science programs far exceeded the 
capacity of the departments.  That caused many departments to make
certain required courses difficult enuf to ensure a high dropout rate
(I worked at a university where the Data Structures course was used to 
eliminate 50% of the students).  Perhaps another factor in students switchin is that
"grade inflation" is higher
in non-science courses.  Typical social science courses give 75% A's and B's,
but hard science courses only give 60% A's and B's.
There may be reasons to switch out of computer science,
but pointers isn't one of them.
</p>

<p>
If you're having trouble with pointers, keep with 
it.  You will get the idea, and it will be clear.
