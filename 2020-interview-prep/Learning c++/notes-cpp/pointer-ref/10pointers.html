<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Pointers</h1>


<h2>Pointers in C/C++</h2>
Pointers are variables that contain memory addresses
(see <a href="05addr-ptr-ref.html">Addresses, Pointers, and References</a>).
They are an essential
data type in C and C++, and are used for the following:
<ul>
   <li>Array variables are pointers and pointers can be used as alternative to subscripts.</li>
   <li>Dynamic memory allocation/deallocation returns a pointer to the allocated memory.</li>
   <li>For efficiency by passing the address of an object instead of copying the
       object to a function.  Reference parameters typically used.</li>
   <li>For function parameters that will be changed by the function
       (<i>out</i> or <i>inout</i> parameters).  Reference parameters typically used.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Declaring a pointer</h2>
Pointers are declared to point to a particular datatype.  
A "*" is written after the type to indicate that this is a pointer to that
type. For example, a pointer to an int would be declared like this.
<pre class="example">
int* ip;  // declares ip to be a pointer to an int.
</pre>
You will also see variations in the spacing such as
<pre class="example">
int *ip;
int * ip;
</pre>

<h2>NULL</h2>
<p>NULL is the pointer to nothing, and should be used as the initial value for
pointers because using NULL will cause an error in most systems.
</p>


<h2>Pointer operators: * (dereference), &amp; (address of), and arithmetic</h2>
Two operators are used when dealing with memory addresses:
<ul>
<li class="compact">Unary &amp; gives the <i>address of</i> (pointer to) something.</li>
<li class="compact">Unary * takes the contents of a pointer (<i>dereferences</i> a pointer).</li>
<li class="compact">Integers can be added to pointers, in which case they are first
     multiplied by the element size</li>
<li class="compact">Two pointers may be subtracted to yield an integer.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Example</h2>
<pre class="example">
char* cp;     // declare pointer to char
char  c, d;   // declare char variables

cp  = &amp;c;     // puts address of c into cp
c   = 'x';    // assigns 'x' to c
*cp = 'x';    // also assigns 'x' to c
d   = *cp;    // copies c's value to d
cp  = &amp;d;     // puts address of d into cp
*cp = c;      // puts value of c into d
</pre>
