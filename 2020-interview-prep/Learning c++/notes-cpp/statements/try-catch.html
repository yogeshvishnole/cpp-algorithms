<h1><a href="../index.html">C++</a>: Statements: try...catch</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre>
   try {
      // normal statements
   } catch (<i>some-exception-type</i> e) {
      // process exception
   }</pre>

<h2>Exceptions are thrown, you can catch them</h2>
      <b>When your program causes an error in some library functions, an <i>exception</i></b>
      is created and <i>thrown</i>.
      The system looks for enclosing <code>try...catch</code> statement that can <i>handle</i>
      (process) this exception.  First it looks to see if the code that caused
      the exception is inside of a <code>try</code> statement that can handle the 
      exception.
      
      <br /><br />If the <code>try</code> statement has a <code>catch</code> part that can 
      handle this type of exception, then it goes to that code.
      
      <br /><br />If there is no <code>try</code> statement around the code that caused
      the error (exception), the system looks at the function that called this function,
      and checks for a <code>try</code> statement there.  It continues unwinding the call
      stack looking for someone who can handle the exception.   Ultimately, the
      system function that called <code>main</code> will handle it if no one
      else does.

        
<h2>Kinds of Exceptions</h2>
       There are many kinds of exceptions, but they can be generally put
       into two groups:
       <ul>
       <li><b>Programming errors</b> -- There is something wrong with your
           program.  For example, you should never get an <code>out_of_range</code> exception.
           If you do, there is something wrong with your program, and you 
           need to fix it.  <b>You never need to catch exceptions from
           programming errors</b>.
           </li>
        <li><b>Input errors</b> -- These are usually errors in the input data.
           The programmer has no control over the input the user gives you,
           eg, file names, integer values, ....  If the user gives you a bad
           value, it may cause an exception when you use it.  
           You need to check for bad input using a <code>try</code> statement.
           </li>
        </ul>

        
<h2><code>try</code> statement -- What you can do to catch Errors</h2>
       You need to put a <code>try</code> statement around any section of code that
       might generate a user generated error.


<h2>Example</h2>
   [need example]


<h2>Advanced</h2>
       You can also use exceptions of your own, and generate them using
       the <b><code>throw</code></b> statement.
