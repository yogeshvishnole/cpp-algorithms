<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Arrays: Buffer Overflow</h1>
Because
<ol>
<li>Arrays are fixed size.</li>
<li>C++ does not perform subscript range checking.</li>
<li>Programmers forget to check bounds, or simply assume
    nothing can go wrong.
    </li>
</ol>
giving a program more data than it can handle is the number one
trick in the arsenal of the hacker.

<p><b>Buffer overflow</b> is the phrase used to describe trying
to put more data into an array than there is room for.
</p>

<h2>What's wrong with this code?</h2>
Hint: What happens in the following loop if there are more than 1000
numbers in the input?


<pre class="example">
int a[1000];       // Declare an array of 1000 ints
int n = 0;         // number of values in a.
. . .
while (cin &gt;&gt; a[n]) {
    n++;
}</pre>

<p>Answer: The additional numbers go somewhere in memory
beyond the end of the array!  They overwrite whatever
was there.  The hacker trick is to figure out where program
instructions occur and supply sufficient data to overwrite 
the instructions.  And to figure out exactly which numbers
are translated into the binary codes for instructions that
they want to be exectuted the next time anyone calls on
the original code.
</p>

<h2>Solution 1 - Check array bounds</h2>
The following solution prevents subscript bounds violations,
by terminating the input after 1000 input numbers without comment. 
<pre class="example">
int a[1000];       // Declare an array of 1000 ints
int n = 0;         // number of values in a.
. . .
while (<span class="hilite">n &lt; 1000 &amp;&amp;</span> cin &gt;&gt; a[n]) {
    n++;
}</pre> 
It would be <i>much</i> better to give
an error message, otherwise the user will not realize
the results from the program are incorrect.  An improvement would be.
<pre class="fragment">
int temp;
while (cin &gt;&gt; temp) {
    if (n &lt; 1000) {
        a[n] = temp;
        n++;
    } else {
        cerr &lt;&lt; "ERROR: More than 1000 number input" &lt;&lt; endl;
        exit(1);
    }
}</pre>

This still has problems.  if we're using a GUI, we can't write to <code>cerr</code>.
The solution to that is to throw an exception, but that example will have to wait.


<h2>Solution 2 - vectors - the correct solution</h2>
Vectors (from the Standard Template Library) are an expandable array. 
Look at <a href="../stl-containers/vector/vector-read-reverse.html">Example - Vector - reverse input</a> example
for a solution to the above problems.
