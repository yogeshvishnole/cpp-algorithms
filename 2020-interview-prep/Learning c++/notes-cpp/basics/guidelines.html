<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Programming Guidelines</h1>


<p>This is a list of a few things that I think are important.  There 
   are a lot more, but this is a start.
   </p>


<h2>Readability vs Efficiency</h2>
<p>Assuming a program executes correctly, the single most important thing is
   <i>readability</i>.  Efficiency is secondary to readability, but it's 
   important to avoid <i>gross inefficiency</i>.  Some of the factors
   that will be used in evaluating a program follow.
   </p>


<h2>Naming</h2>
<p>Names are extremely important in making a program readable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose meaningful names when possible.  Certain common names are 
    ok (<i>i</i> as in iteration variable), but generally they should describe their contents.</li>
<li>Avoid confusing names.  Eg, formal parameter named the same as actual parameters is misleading,
    don't shadow outer names, names shouldn't differ only by case, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Indentation, comments, spacing, ...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Indentation is important.  Use 3, 4, or 5 spaces; 4 is recommended.</li>
<li>Comments at the beginning of every file should identify the program,
    the author, and give the date.</li>
<li>Program sections should be separated (like paragraphs).</li>
<li>Don't comment obvious things.  If something is not obvious it 
    should be commented.  Every function should have at least a one-line
    comments.  Declare variables one per line so that the remainder of
    the line can be used for comments.
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>General coding</h2>
<ul>
<li><i>DRY principle</i> (Don't Repeat Yoursefl).
    If you need to reuse a section of code, don't cut-and-paste it.  Instead
    generalize it with a function or loop.  If it's in both the
    true and false clauses of an <i>if</i>, factor it out. </li>
    
<li>Choose the most appropriate statement for the job.  Yes, you can use 
    <i>switch</i> instead of <i>if</i>, or write all loops with <i>for</i>, 
    but don't do this.</li>
    
<li>Don't reuse the same variable for more than one purpose.  The cost in
    confusion is certainly more than the minor saving of a few bytes.
    </li>
    
<li>Use standard C++ because I'll be using Dev-C++ to compile and test your programs.  
    If you want to use non-standard libraries, clear it with me first.
</li>
</ul>



<h2>Functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>In parameter passing pay attention to whether you should use reference and/or  <i>const</i>.</li>
<li>Functions should be <i>coherent</i> - do one thing.  Don't combine
    multiple tasks in one function.   The function they perform should be reflected
    in the name, which is typically a verb.</li>
</ul>


<h3>C++ Standard</h3>
<p>Avoid non-standard C++ constructions, even tho your compiler may allow non-standard usages.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>main</code> should be <i>int</i>, not <i>void</i>.</li>
<li>Don't use <code>#pragma</code>, it's not portable.</li>
<li>It's really minor (and even stupid), but the standard requires a newline character at the
    end of source files.  If you don't put one there, I see a warning
    message when I compile your program.
    </li>
</ul>
