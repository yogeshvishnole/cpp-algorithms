<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: What values do the I/O operators (&lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;) return?</h1>

<h2>What values do the I/O operators (&lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;) return?</h2>
C++ allows you to define functions to associate with existing operators.
The &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; operators, whose orginal meanings were bitwise left and right shift,
have additional meanings for C++ iostreams.
<!-- For input it's officially called the <i>extraction</i> operator, 
but many programmers won't know what you're talking about if
you use this term.  There's no good, commonly used, name as
far as I know.  I call it the <i>input</i> operator, but I don't
have any reason to believe this is widely used.  -->
So how do they work?

<p>The &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; operators are evaluated left-to-right, so the following are
   equivalent statements, altho writing the parentheses would be 
   rather weird.
</p>

<pre class="fragment">
cin &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b &gt;&gt; c;
(((cin &gt;&gt; a) &gt;&gt; b) &gt;&gt; c);  // Same as above.</pre>

What value is produced, for example, by
<code>(cin &gt;&gt; a)</code>?  And I mean what value is produced in the
expression, not what value is read into the variable.
It calls an overloaded templated function (<code>operator&gt;&gt;</code>) in an 
<code>istream</code> class which reads input
and stores it into the variable on the right.  It then <b>returns the left operand</b> 
(ie, <code>cin</code>) so the result can be used if there is another &gt;&gt; operator.
This <i>chaining</i> of the I/O operators is a rather clever solution.
Here's an example program that shows this.
<pre class="fragment">
    if ((cin &gt;&gt; a) == cin) {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Equal" &lt;&lt; endl;   // Yes, it is true
    } else {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Not Equal" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }</pre>

   
<h2>Why <code>cin</code> can be used as a truth value</h2>
It's possible to make tests like
<pre>
   if (cin)</pre>
which will be true if cin is ok and false if at an end-of-file or has encountered an error.  
It's type is <code>istream&amp;</code> (input stream reference), so how can that be 
used as a truth value.
The trick is that when it's evaluated in the context of a condition, eg, in an <code>if</code>
or <code>while</code> statement, a special function is called in
the <code>istream</code> class.  This function returns a value that can
be interpreted as true or false.

<h2>Reading in the while condition</h2>
<p>Because the &gt;&gt; operator returns the iostream (eg, <code>cin</code>), which can
be tested for EOF or errors, the <code>cin loop</code> idiom can be used.
<pre>   while (cin &gt;&gt; x) { . . . }</pre>
which effectively tests for EOF, and also that the input is a valid value.
