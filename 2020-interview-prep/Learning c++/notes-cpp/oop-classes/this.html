<h1><a href="../index.html">C++</a>: OOP: this</h1>

<p>When you are writing code in a member function, the predefined variable <i><code>this</code></i>
contains a pointer to the current object.  Any member element, for example <i><code>m_x</code></i>, can be referenced
in two ways:
</p>
<pre class="fragment">
m_x = 10;
this->m_x = 10;  // same as above.</pre>
   
<p>References to members are usually written without <code>this</code>
because there is no need to use it, however, there are situations where 
<code>this</code> is needed.
</p>


<h2>Naming clarity</h2>
<p>If a naming convention isn't used that makes member/instance variables 
clear (eg, prefixing such variables with "m_"), the use of <i><code>this</code></i>
can be used to document the nature of the variable.  Naming rules are to be
preferred however.
</p>

<h2>Returning or passing the current object</h2>
<p>The primary use of <i><code>this</code></i> is to return a pointer 
to the current object, or to pass the object to a function.
