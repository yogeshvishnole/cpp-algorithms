<h1><a href="../index.html">C++</a>: Data Structures: Logical Structures - Containers</h1>

<h2>Logical Grouping - Containers</h2>
Everything is built upon the basic hardware-oriented types and groupings.
These features are generally the only ones supported by
directly by basic mainstream programming language features.
However, <i>libraries</i> in C++ and Java provide more abstract ways to group data
implemented as classes.  These more logical structures are often called
<i>containers</i> or <i>collections</i>, and include vectors, lists, sets, maps, ....

<br /><br />To generalize these classes to all types, they are implemented
by means of <i>templates</i>, hence the common name for this library
is the <i>Standard Template Library</i> (STL).

<h2>Example - vector</h2>
An example of changing from a physical, hardware-oriented structure to
a <i>logical</i> structure is moving from an array to a <i>vector</i>. 
This logical <i>container</i> to group data together is not implemented
directly in the C++ language, but with a predefined class library, 
accessed with
<pre>   #include &lt;vector&gt;</pre>

<br />The <code>vector</code> template class allows an array-like
structure that expands automatically as necessary when the user stores more data in it.
The vector is a very nice solution to the problems of fixed array sizes:
<ul>
<li>The programmer can ignore the size because the
    underlying array will be expanded as needed.</li>
</ul>
