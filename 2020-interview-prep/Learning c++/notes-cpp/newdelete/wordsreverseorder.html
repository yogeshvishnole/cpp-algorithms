    <title>C++ Notes: Example - Dynamic C-String Allocation</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Example - Dynamic C-String Allocation</h1>
<p>This example shows dynamic allocation to
<i>allocate arrays of the correct size</i>.
The problem is how to read and save "words".  The solution here is to have an
array of pointers to the words, dynamically allocat space for each word.
A rectangular 2-dimensional array would be very inefficient because 
each row would be as long as the longest possible word, therefore this 
<i>array of arrays</i> solution is better.  There are more
efficient solutions for this particular problem, but this easily
generalizes to applications other than simply listed the words in reverse
order.  This program is similar in structure to the (better) <code>string</code>
and <code>vector</code> solution. </p>

// Program to read words and print in reverse order.

// What this program doesn't do, but should, is reallocate
//     the word and allwords arrays to make them expand
//     as needed.  Currently it is subject to buffer overflows.

        // The pointer is set to NULL to prevent accidental use of it.
        // This isn't necessary here because the program terminates.
        // But it's good practice, and makes bug detection easier.
        delete [] wordList[i];       // free space

This program doesn't dynamically expand the arrays it uses so is subject to the
<i>buffer overflow</i> problem in both the <code>wordList</code>
and <code>inputBuffer</code> arrays.  Fixing this is left as an exercise.
