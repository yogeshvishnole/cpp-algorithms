<h1><a href="../index.html">C++ Notes</a>: Preprocessor: <code>#ifdef</code> and <code>#ifndef</code></h1>
<p>The <code>#ifdef</code> (if defined) and <code>#ifndef</code> (if not defined) 
preprocessor commands are used to
test if a preprocessor variable has been &quot;defined&quot;.  There are 
two common uses for this, with slightly different patterns.
</p>

<h2>Prevent multiple definitions in header files</h2>
<p>When there definitions in a header file that can not be made twice,
the code below should be used.
A header file may be included twice other
include files include it, or an included file includes it and the 
source file includes it again.
</p>

<p>To prevent bad effects from a double include, it is common to surround the
body in the include file with the following (where <code>MYHEADER_H</code> is replaced by a name
that is appropriate for your program).</p>

<pre class="file">
#ifndef MYHEADER_H
#define MYHEADER_H
. . .	// This will be seen by the compiler only once 
#endif /* MYHEADER_H */
</pre>

<h2>Turning debugging code off and on</h2>
Debugging code is necessary in programs, however, it is not usually appropriate
to leave it in the delivered code.  The preprocessor #ifdef commmand can surround
the debugging code.  If DEBUG is defined as below (probably in an include file)
all debugging statement surrounded by the #ifdef DEBUG statement will be active.
However, if it isn't defined, none of the statements will make it thru the 
preprocessor.

<pre class="example">
#define DEBUG
. . .
#ifdef DEBUG
  . . . // debugging output
#endif
</pre>
