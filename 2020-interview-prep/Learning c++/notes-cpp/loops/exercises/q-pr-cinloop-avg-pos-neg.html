<h1><a href="../../index.html">C++</a>: Programming Exercise - Average Positive Negative</h1>


<p>Name: _________________________________ </p>

<p>Write a complete program which reads floating point numbers from cin and 
    computes two averages: the average of the negative numbers it reads and the average
    of the positive numbers it reads.  
</p>
<p>
For example, for input 9 -1 -1 -4 1 the positive
    average would be 5 (the sum of the positive numbers (9+1) divided by the number of
    positive numbers (2).  By a similar process the average of the negative numbers 
    would be -2 (ie, ((-1 + -1 + -4) / 3).  You don't need to write any functions for
    this problem.
