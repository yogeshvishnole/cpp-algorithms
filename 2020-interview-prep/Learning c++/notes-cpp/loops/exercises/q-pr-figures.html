<h1><a href="../../index.html">C++</a>: Programming Problem - Figures</h1>

Here are some classic programming problems that require the use of nested loops.
A frequent textbook problem is to draw figures using characters.
If you already know how to define functions, you might find it useful to
write convenience functions to help you.

<p>You're welcome to change the appearance of these, or
 produce something a little different.  The point of
 this is to give you practice with loops and functions,
 so show what you can do.

<li class="question"><b>Print a rectangle</b>.  Read a height and width and
print a rectangle with that height and width.  This example output
has height 3 and width 7.
  <pre>
          
          *******
          *******
          *******</pre>
  
  <p>Sample solution.</p>
  <div class="fragment"><pre>
int width, height;
    
while (cin &gt;&gt; width &gt;&gt; height) {
    for (int row=0; row&lt;height; row++) {
        for (int col=0; col&lt;width; col++) {
            cout &lt;&lt; "*";
        }
        cout &lt;&lt; endl;  // end the line of stars.
    }
}
</pre></div>
</li>

<li class="question">
<b>Print a triangle</b>.  Read a number and print a triangle of
that size.  This example is of size 6.
  <pre>
  
          *
          **
          ***
          ****
          *****
          ******</pre>
  
Here is a solution.
<pre class="fragment">
int size;

while (cin &gt;&gt; size) {
    for (int row=1; row&lt;=size; row++) {
        for (int col=0; col&lt;row; col++) {
            cout &lt;&lt; "*";
        }
        cout &lt;&lt; endl;  // end the line.
    }
}
</pre>
</li>

<li class="question">
<b>Print a triangle</b>.  Read a number and print a triangle of
that size.  This is a little different than the problem above
because you'll have to print some spaces at the beginning 
of each line.  This example is of size 6.
  <pre>

</li>
<li class="question"><b>Print a rectangle outline</b>.  Read a height and width and print a rectangle
that looks like the one below.  This example has a height of 5 and width of 7.
You might choose one of two approaches to this problem.
<ol>
<li>Break it down into three problems: a line of stars; lines consisting of
    a star, blanks, and a star; and again a line of stars.
    </li>
<li>At each position write either a star or blank.  Use an <code>if</code> 
    statement to test for first or last row of first or last column, in
    which case a star is printed, otherwise print a blank.
    </li>
</ol>
  <pre>
          
          *******
          *     *

          *     *
          *******</pre>

<li class="question">
<p><b>Print a pyramid</b>. Read (in a loop of course) a number, n,
and print a pyramid that has that size.
The example below shows what would be printed for n=4.
</p>
        <pre>
        
            *
           * *
          * * *
         * * * *</pre>
 </li>
 
<li class="question"><b>Print a parallelogram</b>. Again read n in a loop.  For each value of n
  produce output that makes a parallelogram like the 
  following for n=6.  You might find it easier to solve this to breaking
  the problem into two simpler problems: eg, thinking of this as an upper triangle
  and a lower triangle.
