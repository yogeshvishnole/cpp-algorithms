<h1><a href="../../index.html">C++</a>: Programming Problem - Game to remove tokens</h1>


<h2>Description of game</h2>
There two-person game starts by placing
about 20 tokens (coins, cards, stones, ...) on the table.
The players take turns removing either one, two, or three tokens on
each turn.  The loser is the player who is forced to take the
last token.

<h2>Program</h2>
Write a program to play this game against a human.

<p>You should use incremental programming techniques, which
means that you should start with a very small <i>working</i>
program, and make improvements to it <i>in small steps</i>
that you test each time.  For example,
</p>
<ol>
<li>First write a program that simply prints out instructions.</li>
<li>Then modifiy it to print a starting
    number (eg, 20) with a loop reading numbers from the human opponent.
    </li>
<li>Next add checking to see if they entered a legal number (1-3).</li>
<li>Next subtract their entry from the total number of tokens 
    and terminate the loop when the number of
    tokens is zero.</li>
<li>Calculate a response to the user's input so your program plays against them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe these aren't exactly the steps that you want to use, but this style
of incremental development is very, very successful.  Also it should always
leave you with a running, but possibly incomplete, program - the version before
the last increment.
</p>

<h2>Improvements</h2>
<ol>
<li>Randomize the initial value.</li>
<li>Figure out how to play optimally, and make random moves when that isn't possible.</li>
<li>Let the user choose to go first or second.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ol>
