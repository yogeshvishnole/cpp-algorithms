<h1>CMIS 140: Final Exam - Programming</h1>
Name __________________________________

<br /><br />There are five programming problems, and for each of them you 
have the choice of one of two problems.  Three of the programs are identical
to what you have done before.  You may use arrays for all of these problems
and do not have to use pointers.  This is a <b>closed book</b> exam.
<ol>
<li>(5 points) Write one of:
    <ol type="a">
    <li>Write a <code>myStrlen</code> function which is the same as the library 
    <code>strlen</code> function - it returns the length of the string.  
    Assume the prototype is
    <pre>    int myStrlen(char a[]);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Write a function which shortens a string to n characters.  If the string is 
    shorter than n, the function should not change the string.
    Assume the prototype is
    <pre>    int truncate(char a[], int n);</pre>
    </li>
    </ol>
</li>

<li>(10 points) Write one of:
    <ol type="a">
    <li>Write the <code>myStrcat</code> function which is the same as the 
    library <code>strcat</code> function (concatenates b on the end of a).  
    Assume the prototype is
    <pre>    void myStrcat(char a[], char b[]);</pre>
    </li>
    
    <li>Write a function to add extra blanks to the <i>right</i> end of a string to 
    make it at least length <i>width</i>.  If the string is already <i>width</i> characters or longer,
    do not change the string.  
    Assume the prototype is
    <pre>    void padRight(char a[], int width);</pre>
    </li>
    </ol>
</li>

<li>(10 points) Write one of:
    <ol type="a">
    <li>Write a function to remove all leading blanks from the <i>left</i> end of a string.
    Assume the prototype is
    <pre>    void trimLeft(char a[]);</pre>
    </li>
    
    <li>Write a function to add extra blanks to the <i>left</i> end of a string to 
    make it at least length <i>width</i>.  If the string is already <i>width</i> characters or longer,
    do not change the string.  
    Assume the prototype is
    <pre>    void padLeft(char a[], int width);</pre>
    </li>
    </ol>
</li>

<li>(10 points) Write one of:
    <ol type="a">
    <li>A main program that reads a number n, and prints a triangle made of stars (*)
        which has a height and width of n that looks like this for n=5:
        <pre>
            *
           **
          ***
         ****
        *****
        </pre>
    </li>
    
    <li>A main program that reads a number n, and prints a hollow square made of stars (*)
        which has a height and width of n that looks like this for n=5:
        <pre>
        *****
        *   *
        *   *
        *   *
        *****
        </pre>
    </li>
    </ol>
</li>

<li>(15 points) Write one of:
    <ol type="a">
    <li>Write a main program to read (in a loop) names into two variables: firstName and lastName.
        Write out the names as <i>last, first</i>.  Before you print them, you
        must capitalize the first character, and make the other characters lowercase.
        You may use the library functions
        such as <code>toupper</code> and <code>tolower</code> which work on
        single characters.
        <br />Example input and output:
        <br />Input: <code>Mickey Mouse</code> Output: <code>Mouse, Mickey</code> Note: switch with ", " between.
        <br />Input: <code>mickey mouse</code> Output: <code>Mouse, Mickey</code> Note: capitalize first character.
        <br />Input: <code>mIcKeY MoUse</code> Output: <code>Mouse, Mickey</code> Note: make remaining characters lowercase.
    </li>
    <li>Write a main program that reads many words one-by-one in a loop.  Print the 
        alphabetically last
        word (according the strpcmp).  You will find the library functions
        <code>strcmp</code> and <code>strcpy</code> useful.
        This is basically the same algorithm as used for finding the
        maximum of a series of integers, but there are a number of changes needed for strings.
        You may assume that the smallest possible value for a string is "" (the
        empty string with no characters in it).
