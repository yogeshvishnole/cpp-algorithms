1. More typesafe

2. More libraries 

3. Less reliance on preprocessor

4. Object Oriented as well as imperative

5. Function overloading  --> c++ uses signature
     matching algorithm for this purpose.

NOTE That c++ Make excessive use of 
signature matching algorithm.

6. Generic programming


C++ New stuff in functions

1.  default parameters , variable argument lists

2. const parameters  --> const parameters are immutable
     inside the function body. And this concept is called 
      as "const correctnes"

3. Multiple types in a generic

4. Operator overloading
